# Quick Start

This guide should take a new user from package installation to the first successful use of `Workes.ConsoleSystem`.

## Prerequisites

You need:

- a .NET project compatible with .NET Standard 2.1.
- the .NET SDK or another NuGet-capable development environment.
- a UI, engine integration, or host application that will render the console history.

## Install The Package

Install from NuGet:

```bash
dotnet add package Workes.ConsoleSystem --version 0.1.0
```

Or add a package reference:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Workes.ConsoleSystem" Version="0.1.0" />
```

The package targets .NET Standard 2.1.

## Minimal Setup

```csharp
using Workes.ConsoleSystem.Core;

var console = new ConsoleManager();
```

Keep the `ConsoleManager` instance for the lifetime of the host console. The package does not enforce a singleton, but most applications should create one logical console manager during startup.

## First Working Example

```csharp
using System;
using Workes.ConsoleSystem.Core;
using Workes.ConsoleSystem.Entries;

var console = new ConsoleManager();

console.Log.Information("Console ready.");
console.Log.Error("Example error message.");

foreach (var entry in console.History.Entries)
{
    if (entry is LogEntry log)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{log.Timestamp:u} [{log.Level}] {log.Message}");
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates the currently implemented behavior: logging writes `LogEntry` values into the shared chronological history.

Command registration, parsing, execution, permissions, aliases, arguments, and autocomplete are not implemented in the initial skeleton.

- CHANGELOG.md for release history and migration-sensitive changes.
